<h5>Travellers</h5>

<p>Hey there! This is Ayushkar Roy I'm currently working on web and Android development via open-source projects and hands-on real-world projects.  
    I feel extremely pleased to share my new application which I had developed recently
    It includes features like a Daily task tracker, a World clock converter, an Expense Tracker, a Current location tracker, knowing your weather condition, a Currency converter etc. 
    Nevertheless, this app craves to add multiple features that further benefits the users of this app, hence I will continue to work on this app until we attain a notch where the users feel ecstatic to share the application.
    Please feel free to share the bugs related to the application  I will be more than happy to get the bugs fixed.
    Thank you.</p>
